-- User Analysis Task_2: Analyzing Time to Repeat

-- STEP 1: Identify the relevant new sessions
-- STEP 2: Use the user_id values from STEP 1 to find any repeat sessions those users had
-- STEP 3: Find the created_at times for  first and second sessions
-- STEP 4: Find the differences between first and second sessions at a user level
-- STEP 5: Aggregate the user level data to find the average, min, max
